# App-Message
This project consists of the development of an integrative messaging backend that connects instant messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, with the OpenAI API.
The application receives messages sent by users through WhatsApp or Telegram, processes them, and sends them to the OpenAI API to obtain a smart real-time response. Subsequently, the generated response is returned to the user on the same platform from which the inquiry was made.
This system allows for the creation of a centralized conversational assistant, capable of answering questions, making inquiries, generating texts, or executing automated tasks using OpenAI's artificial intelligence, maintaining fluid communication across multiple messaging channels.
